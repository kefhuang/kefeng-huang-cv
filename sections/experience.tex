\subsection{{Recycl.one Mobile App Team Leader
    \hfill 10/2020 --- 05/2021}}
\subtext{Supervised by Mr. Hardwick James at University College London and 
    Mr. Fergus Kidd at Avanade 
    \hfill London, UK}
\begin{zitemize}
    \item \textbf{Technology}: We used Flutter \& Dart to build the mobile app and
        the backend is written in Java using Spring Boot deployed at Azure 
        providing RESTful APIs.
        Azure MySQL server and Azure Computer Vision API is also used by the 
        backend.
    \item \textbf{Team Work}: This project was to build a demo app for the client
        at Avanade to encourage people recycle more materials. We were working
        as a team of 3 people and our idea is to build an app that can identify
        the items that people want to recycle and show the drop-off point that 
        collects the corresponding items. Once an item has been recycled, they 
        will receive points on their app account.
    \item \textbf{Personal Contribution}: As I am familiar with both Flutter and
        Spring Boot, I became the team leader and focus on implementing the 
        backend while helping my teammates with the app development as well.
