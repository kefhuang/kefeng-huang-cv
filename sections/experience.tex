    UCL Computer Science Robotics Internship
    \hfill 06/2022 - 08/2022
}}
\subtext{
    Supervised by Prof. Simon Julier, Prof. Dimitrios Kanoulas and Dr. Francisco Porto Guerra E Vasconcelos
}
\begin{zitemize}
    \item   \textbf{Robot:} myAGV developed by ElephantRobotics and Huawei,
            which is the smallest 6 DOF compound robot with Mecanum wheels.
    \item   \textbf{Environment:} ROS Noetic. Created a simulated environment in Gazebo.
    \item   Wrote related course materials for UCL module COMP0128, COMP0129 and COMP0130.
            Read and visualized sensor data (camera, lidar,..). Explored related
            algorithms including moving the robot in a pre-defined trajectory and
            moving the arm to a pre-defined location in robot coordinates.
            Provided demonstration code and comprehensive explanations and tutorials for all of those algorithms.

\subsection{{Recycl.one Mobile App Team Leader
    \hfill 10/2020 --- 05/2021}}
\subtext{Supervised by Mr. Hardwick James at University College London and 
    Mr. Fergus Kidd at Avanade 
    \hfill London, UK}
\begin{zitemize}
    \item \textbf{Technology}: We used Flutter \& Dart to build the mobile app and
        the backend is written in Java using Spring Boot deployed at Azure 
        providing RESTful APIs.
        Azure MySQL server and Azure Computer Vision API is also used by the 
        backend.
    \item \textbf{Team Work}: This project was to build a demo app for the client
        at Avanade to encourage people recycle more materials. We were working
        as a team of 3 people and our idea is to build an app that can identify
        the items that people want to recycle and show the drop-off point that 
        collects the corresponding items. Once an item has been recycled, they 
        will receive points on their app account.
    \item \textbf{Personal Contribution}: As I am familiar with both Flutter and
        Spring Boot, I became the team leader and focus on implementing the 
        backend while helping my teammates with the app development as well.

\subsection{{Citrix Summer Intern
    \hfill 07/2020 --- 08/2020}}
\begin{zitemize}
    \item \textbf{Description}: My main work is to use JavaScript to write an
        chrome extension that can capture events such as pop up windows
        and visualize the past data under the supervision of a senior engineer.
        Personally I got the Campus Star Award.

\subsection{{China Mobile AI Department Intern
    \hfill 04/2020 --- 06/2020}}
\begin{zitemize}
    \item \textbf{Description}: I was assigned as an intern in a team focus on
        extract company seals from the contract. My job was to learn to use the
        openCV library and implement the ELSDc algorithm to extract circles
        from the images.

\subsection{{UCollege X Mobile App
    \hfill 01/2020 --- 05/2020}}
\begin{zitemize}
    \item \textbf{Description}: This is personal project where python is used
        to scrape data from websites like QS and Times ranking and then a mobile
        app written in Flutter visualized the data for a clearer comparison 
        between universities and degrees.
