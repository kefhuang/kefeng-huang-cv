\begin{zitemize}
    \item   As a team of 3, created an app to encourage people recycle unused materials by showing
            the drop-off position of the identified item and giving 'points' to them
            once they have completed one recycle. It motivated people by giving weekly and daily
            tasks which can earn bonus 'points'. 'Points' will be shown on the global scoreboard 
            and can also be used to redeem in-app rewards.  
    \item   Developed and Deployed a SpringBoot backend providing RESTful APIs.
            Used Azure Computer Vision API to accomplish item identifying tasks.
            Used MySQL Server to store account details. 
    \item   Created the item identifying page and the scoreboard page in the Flutter app and connected it
            to the backend. Helped teammates with other pages when necessary. 
    \item   Organize team's weekly tasks and prepare a weekly report to clients. 
    \item   Received 1st Class Distinction result
