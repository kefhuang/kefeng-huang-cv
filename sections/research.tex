\subsection{{Robotic System for Identifying and Watering House Plants 
    \hfill 10/2021 --- 04/2022}}
\subtext{Supervised by Prof. Simon Julier at University College London}
\begin{zitemize}
    \item \textbf{Brief}: 
        Created an autonomous robotic system to water houseplants
        in a simulated environment in ROS Noetic, with a group of 6 people working in 
        different aspects including
        SLAM, Control, Path Planing, Classification \& Detection and Exploration.
        Available on Github repository
        \url{https://github.com/Aashvin/COMP0031-PlantBot}.
    \item \textbf{Classification \& Detection}: 
        Conducted a literature review on detection and 
        segmentation methods as well as the plant identification networks.
        Integrated Darknet\_ROS package into our project. 
        Modified the package to support YOLOv4.
        Available on Github repository

\subsection{{Image Based Point Cloud Segmentation 
    \hfill 08/2021 --- Present}}
\begin{zitemize}
    \item \textbf{Technology}: Experiments are run over KITTI-Odometry dataset 
        as it contains both images and point cloud in each frame.
        SemanticKITTI is also used to provide the labels.
        Python is the main programming language as well as Pytorch to train
        the network.
        Nvidia Segmentation (DeepV3WPlus) is adapted to extract features from 
        images.
    \item \textbf{Description}: Each 3D point is first projected to images within
        the same frame and the frames before. 
        It is first implemented to choose the mode of the labels of the same point
        on different images. 
        Then it is improved by making predictions using the features of the images
        instead.
        A network is trained on a new dataset that combines the actual point
        label and the corresponding images features. 
\end{zitemize}
