    \hfill 10/2021 --- Present}}
\subtext{Supervised by Prof. Simon Julier at University College London}
\begin{zitemize}
    \item \textbf{Technology}: The robot is simulated over ROS and python is the main
        programming language. 
    \item \textbf{Team Work}: We worked together as a team of 6 people, with different
        people working on different aspects including SLAM, Control, 
        Path Planning and etc. Each person will implement the corresponding 
        nodes in ROS and information is transferred using technics including
        Topics.
    \item \textbf{Personal Contribution}: I am responsible for the object 
        detection and plant identification. 
        A 3-month literature review is first conducted on detection and 
        segmentation methods as well as the plant identification networks.
        Currently I am implementing the YOLOv3 nodes which takes the images
        as input and return detected objects and their bounding boxes.

\subsection{{Image Based Point Cloud Segmentation 
    \hfill 08/2021 --- Present}}
\subtext{Guided by PhD student Henry at University of Oxford}
\begin{zitemize}
    \item \textbf{Technology}: Experiments are run over KITTI-Odometry dataset 
        as it contains both images and point cloud in each frame.
        SemanticKITTI is also used to provide the labels.
        Python is the main programming language as well as Pytorch to train
        the network.
        Nvidia Segmentation (DeepV3WPlus) is adapted to extract features from 
        images.
    \item \textbf{Description}: Each 3D point is first projected to images within
        the same frame and the frames before. 
        It is first implemented to choose the mode of the labels of the same point
        on different images. 
        Then it is improved by making predictions using the features of the images
        instead.
        A network is trained on a new dataset that combines the actual point
        label and the corresponding images features.
